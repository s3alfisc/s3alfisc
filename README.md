In my free time, I develop R packages that implement various inference procedures:

+ `fwildclusterboot` implements the fast wild cluster bootstrap algorithm as suggested in Roodman, MacKinnon, Nielsen & Webb for a range of regression packages in R. It also ports functionality from [WildBootTests.jl]() to R, e.g. the WRE bootstrap for instrumental variables.

+ `wildrwolf` utilizes `fwildclusterboot's` speed and implements the multiple-hypothesis correction as suggested by Romano & Wolf (2005) for regression objects from the `fixest` package. 

+ `CRV3J` implements the Jackknive CRV3 estimator as suggested by MacKinnon, Nielsen & Webb (2022). 

I hope to bring to bring the last packages two to CRAN by the end of the summer - if you'd like to help me get there, please don't hesitate to send me an email to alexander-fischer1801[at]t-online.de ðŸ˜„
